Idk about the persistence tho. 




Todo:
1) the bar graph is too stylish for calorie tracking, the ends should not fade, they should hard end. (optional)
2) on the dashboard, it shouldnt say the exercice for the current day, it should say, the day i did last time. bonus points for adding hou many days been since just to rub salt in the wounds.
3) ad white borders around days in the calendars.
4) adjust the position of the burger menu
5) Give the app a proper name and host it.
6) Make a mobile app version of this.
7)
